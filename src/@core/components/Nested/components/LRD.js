          • Looking for Funding? Do you have a property that you are putting up
          for lease? 1 Click Capital now offers you instant capital against your
          leased property. This way you can get quick funds using your rental as
          a collateral.</p>
           <p>• LRD is a form of term loan that grants you a
          funds using rental receipts as a collateral. It works on the premise
          of rental properties being owed a fixed amount of rent.</p>
           <p>• How does LRD works? There are many commercial properties
          that are up for lease. A term loan known as Lease Rental Discounting
          is provided against commercial real estate or property.</p>
          
          <p>Lease rental discounting works like factoring. LRD works when you
          enter into a rental contract with a tenant. We offer you capital at 2
          % of your entire rent capital for the next 1 or 2 years. The renter
          then pays the rent inform of EMIs to the lending party.</p>
           <p>•Lease Rental Discounting agreements have to be signed between three
          parties: the owner, the lender (1 Click Capital) and the tenant.</p>
          <p>• If you own a property and there is a prospect of fixed
          rentals for the long term, you can be eligible for the Lease Rental
          Discounting or LRD Loan.</p><p> • If you are the owner of a property
          with a perspective fixed rental for a long tenure you can be eligible
          for Lease Rental Discounting. </p>
